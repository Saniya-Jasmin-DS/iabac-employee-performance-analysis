Employee Performance Analysis
Goal 2: Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance
The top three important features affecting the performance rating are ordered with their importance level as follows,

1.Employment Environment Satisfaction

2.Employee Salary Hike Percentage

3.Experience Years In CurrentRole

Employee Enviroment satisfaction: Maximum Number of Employees Performance Rating belongs to EmpEnvironmentSatisfaction Level 3 & Level 4, It contains 367 & 361.

Employee last salary hike percent: More Number of Employees whose salary hike percentage belongs to 11-19 % are getting 2 & 3 performance rating Maximum time. as well asEmployees whose salary hike percentage is in between 20-22%, There performance rating is 4.

Employee work life balance: In EmpWorkLifeBalance, level 3 is showing high Performance Rating of employees

Goal 3: A Trained model which can predict the employee performance
The trained model is created using the machine learning algorithm as follows with the accuracy score,

Support Vector Classifier: 96.76% accuracy
Artifical Neural Network [Multilayer percepton]: 95.80% 3.Random Forest classifier: 95.61% accuracy
Support vector machine well perform on training data with accuracy 96.80% but the test score is 94.09% after applying Hyperparameter tunning score is 96.73% means model is overfit.

Artifical neural network[Multilayer percepton] perform very well on training data with 99.28% accuracy and testing score is 95.61% .

Random forest very well perform in training data with 100% accuracy but in testing 93.90% after doing hyperparameter tunning testing score is decreases.

So we are select Artifical neural network [Multilayer percepton] model.

Goal 4: Recommendations to improve the employee performance
The overall employee performance can be achieved by employee environment satisfaction. The company needs to focus more on the employee environment satisfaction.

The salary hike will give the boost to the employees to perform well.

Promote the employee ervery 6th month

Improve Employee's work-life balance this affects the performance rating.

While recruiting for HR, consider the female candidates where they perform well compared to male.

The development and sales department is having an overall higher performance comparing to rest of the departments. While some of the employees who gives feedback like Low & Medium from Job Satisfaction & Relationship Satisfaction feature, such employees gives Excellent performance more in number. So company should focus on them.
