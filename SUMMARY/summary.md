✅ Employee Performance Analysis – Project Summary
Goal 1: Data Understanding and Data Processing

The employee performance dataset was analyzed to understand its structure, features, and data quality. Data preprocessing steps were performed, including handling missing values, removing duplicate records, correcting data types, and transforming categorical variables into a suitable format. Feature scaling and encoding techniques were applied where necessary to prepare the dataset for analysis and model building.

Goal 2: Top 3 Important Factors Affecting Employee Performance

The top three most important factors influencing employee performance ratings were identified and ranked as follows:

Employee Environment Satisfaction

Employee Salary Hike Percentage

Years of Experience in Current Role

Employee Environment Satisfaction:
The majority of employees with higher performance ratings belong to Environment Satisfaction Levels 3 and 4, with 367 and 361 employees respectively. This indicates that a positive work environment significantly improves employee performance.

Employee Salary Hike Percentage:
Employees receiving salary hikes between 11%–19% mostly achieve Performance Ratings 2 and 3. Employees with salary hikes between 20%–22% consistently achieve the highest performance rating (4), showing a strong relationship between salary increments and performance.

Work-Life Balance:
Employees with Work-Life Balance Level 3 show higher performance ratings compared to other levels, highlighting the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

Goal 3: Predictive Model for Employee Performance

Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to predict employee performance:

Support Vector Classifier (SVC):

Training Accuracy: 96.80%

Testing Accuracy: 94.09%

After hyperparameter tuning: 96.73%

Shows slight overfitting

Artificial Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron):

Training Accuracy: 99.28%

Testing Accuracy: 95.61%

Demonstrates good generalization and stable performance

Random Forest Classifier:

Training Accuracy: 100%

Testing Accuracy: 93.90%

Performance decreased after hyperparameter tuning

Final Model Selection:
The Artificial Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron) model was selected due to its balanced accuracy and better generalization on unseen data.

Goal 4: Recommendations to Improve Employee Performance

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

Improve employee environment satisfaction, as it has the strongest impact on performance.

Provide competitive salary hikes to motivate employees.

Promote employees every six months to maintain engagement.

Enhance work-life balance, which significantly affects performance.

During HR recruitment, consider female candidates, as they show comparatively higher performance.

Employees in the Development and Sales departments demonstrate higher overall performance.

Employees reporting Low or Medium Job Satisfaction and Relationship Satisfaction still deliver excellent performance; management should focus on supporting these employees.
